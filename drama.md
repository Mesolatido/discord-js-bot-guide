# The End of an Era
Lemme tell you a story. Stay a while, and Listen!

> **Update**: Los Discordos belongs to me again. The story has come full circle!
 
## The Beginning

I joined Discord to start coding at the end of May 2016, just as much a noob as anybody else:

I asked about a guide, and I was given what was then the only help in the matter: the bot "auth" link, with an indication to put in my Client ID in the URL. And immediately I knew that the lack of examples in the docs was an issue for me. I don't read "APISpeak", you see, so classes and inheritance are just gobbledigook.

So I asked all the noob questions. How do I get a list of users from a Cache? Why is my bot staying online after it's stopped? How do I test a member join event without constantly joining with an alt? All those things, I went through the same as everyone else. 

But it quickly became apparent that I would probably be helping a lot of people myself and quite soon:

Within a month, I had this guide up, with a few interesting pages. In fact my first commit (when I created the book) was on June 18th, less than 3 weeks after I first joined Discord API! That first day I had a Linux, Windows and generic "Getting Started" up and running, as well as "Your Basic Bot" and the "Events and Handlers" page, all of which have survived almost untouched to this day (except for version updates).

## Los Discordos

Fast forward about 3 months. My guide is starting to look really solid, I'm helping noobs left and right, things are going well. But then *dun dun duuuuuun* drama occurs. I get pissed off at losing my "Proficient" title I fought for, because of a minor altercation, and I leave DAPI. I create a separate guild called "Los Discordos" (discord.js with Blackjack and Hookers!) and immediately I start seeing what kind of contribution I was really bringing to Discord.js:

Even after I joined back, Los Discordos remained and became the hub of the devs, contribs and proficients of Discord.js. I had made the server and was owner at the beginning of course, and things were going well. We had some test bots, we had serious discussions about the lib, we had fun, all was well. 

I felt that I had become friends with hydra, that we had a good understanding between us, and that we were a team. He made a great lib, contribs helped with code, and I made the training material as well as guided pretty much *all* the noobs to glory as I had been brought up myself.

There *was* a bit of drama because *someone* didn't want to join with me as server owner, and I was forced to relinquish ownership to hydrabolt. I remained at the top nonetheless, but still, *my* server was now in the hands of someone else. 

## The Discord.js Official Server

At one point it became clear that the Discord API channel was feeling cramped. There were thousands of messages being sent to the channel every day and even with tags it became difficult to manage all the questions that were coming in. It took a few weeks to convince hydra that making an official server was a necessity. After it was made clear that everyone wanted to keep Los Discordos separate, we finally got to the point where the server was created. 

On September 4th 2016, a little over 3 months after I joined the world of Discord bot coding, I personally created Discord.js Official and started building the community. Initially the staff were all the Los Discordos people, of course, and some proficients that were still active otherwise. 

Why was **I** the owner of the server? Because Hydrabolt did not believe it would succeed, he wanted to concentrate on coding, and left me in charge of making things run smoothly. And they did. Within 1 week of creating the guild we already had 30% of the activity of DAPI with .04% of the member count. Within a month we had 500 users. Today, there are 2322 members, 21 text channels, 14 roles. While I was not *alone* in generating this success, I certainly feel like I was the greatest part of it.

## The Guides and Videos

Throughout all this, of course, my guide grew into what it is today. 3 months ago I started thinking about doing a video series, and I did - my Evie.Codes channel grew to about 250 subs within a month, and is now close to 600 subs with 17,000 views. And this guide? Well this guide has had 43,000 views (5,700 unique visitors) this last month alone.

With each new passing day it's made clearer that there is a good number of people that get into coding bots in Discord.js, that learn the basics and get up and running, using the material I provide. 

## Depression and Drama

Without going into too many details, I've had events in my life that lead me into a depression. Barely able to work, emotional, cranky (more than usual), that was me. And while it's of course no fault of anyone else that I became this way, I felt almost little support from what became of the moderation team of Discord.js. And on top of that, I had to deal with the toxicity of the community.

What do I mean by this nice buzzword, "toxicity"? Well, this is a systemic problem in Discord, especially in the programming circles: Telling people their code is "shit" as a joke. The number of times I heard this, the number of times that I was "jokingly" bashed for my shit code far surpases the number of thank you's and congratulations I received from the rest of the staff. So I depressed even more because part of me took it seriously. Part of me wasn't up to the challenge of believing in myself. 

So I decided to "take a break" and, for the 2nd time, transferred ownership of a successful guild into the hands of Hydrabolt. I stepped down from Server Owner and became a Mod. And continued getting told my code was shit by *some* people. 

And by the time I realized where I had gone wrong, by the time I actually looked at the guide's statistics and saw that even after a month of "taking a break" and no new contents I was still gaining new subs, comments, likes and so many views on my channel, I had already ruined some of my reputation as a leader.

I was cranky, easily triggered, had little patience with trolls and morons. Moreso than usual, and that's saying a lot. So when I started gaining confidence back in myself, and telling off the trolls in the staff that kept bashing me, I came across as very angry, and tensions arose. I felt more and more like I wasn't appreciated. And I felt like hydrabolt wasn't up to the task of defending my work at all. He remained unaffected by it, detached, and barely apologetic. 

So I had enough. And I left the guild that I had created. And it made a bit of a fuss, but not enough apparently to get anyone to talk to me. So here's what really broke me: I left the guild, and the people at the top, mainly hydra, simply did not talk to me. I had other allies, thankfully, whom I still consider good friends. And some that remained neutral and I still respect. But at the top of d.js sat people who couldn't care less for me as far as I could tell.

Regardless of this I kept on truckin'. I couldn't *not* help the people in the Discord-js channel of DAPI so I helped them. I pointed them to the right direction. I was there for them while others were either ignoring it, or they came in just to troll & scream at people for being idiots.

## The shit and bullshit

After a week or so, however, I *did* suddenly get a contact: hydra was telling me to "ease off the noobs", as if I was somehow affecting his reputation. And, admittedly, honestly, I lost it. Blew a fuse. Screamed at him and insulted him. Because I realized he didn't have my back. And through this, some *actual* allies that I had, were transmitting what was actually happening behind the scenes that I no longer had access to: name-calling, insulting, bashing, demeaning of my character with no regards to what I had contributed. This came from *most* people in the discord.js staff, and though some tried to defend or remained neutral, most of what I saw was an unabated onslaught of insult. And yet, during this time hydra was pretending to want to calm me down, pretending things were going well, that I could come back. 

Even when faced with proof of what I knew, he did not relent is pretending he wanted things to be better. But he refused to accept the fact that his staff had become uncontrollable. During the time I was out, not only did I get a solid bashing, the staff were trolling everyone (locking down the general channel for no reason, spamming emojis and having heated arguments in public). Also a lot of *personal* insults went directly to hydra, who ignored them and kept on trying to calm things down with almost zero success. 

And yet he was still trying to get me back, because somewhere deep inside hydra knows that I helped in making the *current* lib's popularity. I don't pretend to have single-handedly made his lib great or #1, mind you. I only contributed to it, but that contribution, I felt, accounted for a *sizeable chunk* of the success of both the server and the continual growth of the lib. 

I negotiated getting back into the same role I was before or higher. I tried to explain that there needed to be a cleanup, and that the contributions of one did not excuse their shitty behaviour, trolling, insulting, and bashing. But I was denied because (and I'm not kidding) *one* mod that **I had put into that position** was threatening to leave if I came back to the same level. 

So I made the mistake of actually accepting. I came back, as a proficient, and I witnessed the full extent of just how wild the server had become. While I am to be considered a "Nazimod" by most, a name which definitely fits in some ways, it's clear to me that the "hand of steel" by which I was governing the server before my ultimate demise caused by my depression was the only thing keeping the trolls in check. Ousted from this position by stupid events, I was now powerless to effect any change. 

## The conclusion, and opinions

My last day of discord.js was seeing proficients being suddenly removed a permission that was helpful to their jobs - the ability to delete messages, which became evident when we tried to delete an invite code someone posted - while the mods were busy insulting each other in the staff discussion room. 

For me, personally, it's clear that as much as I was a Nazimod when it came to end-users, I had ultimate trust in every single person in the staff and that was important. I didn't feel it necessary to question anyone's actions (I saw plenty of bans from staff that I couldn't identify the source/reason of and never *once* questioned them on it seriously). And here we had one person that was constantly putting into question everything everyone did. Someone else left because of this, someone that had been there from the start, and no one seemed to care.

I decided to finally leave permanently that day. And not only that, I also decided that I was completely done with the whole library. I am no longer going to be updating this guide, I will be making no more videos, because I cannot possibly support a library where the moderation staff and contributors feel they have the freedom to insult, troll, bash, and destroy anyone in their path. I cannot consider allying with a library owner that hypocritically talks shit behind my back and pretends that he's "sorry" in private but refuses to defend me publicly. 

I deleted all my bots (the most popular one, no-mention-spam, was admittedly not very useful anymore), and short of deleting my videos and guides, I will be locking them down and no longer maintaining or updating them. It's a shame that it came down to this, but I simply cannot continue.

One last not that I feel is very important: My opinion of the skills involved in programming discord.js, maintaining and updating it, are not in any way affected by the negative behaviour of the people involved. Just because I can't stand trolls, jackasses and idiots, does not mean I think their code is in any way inferior. However, technical expertise does not excuse the ultimately disappointing behaviour and poisonous attitudes of those people.

## What you can do about it

At this point, my drama is done. I made shitty decisions and things that I'm not proud of, including telling everyone in my private server to go ping hydra to "let him know how much of a mistake it was to let me go". It was, of course, a dick move which I should have refrained from executing but it felt good at the time. So, please don't raid, spam, or otherwise diminish the quality of the Discord.js server more than I've already pushed people to do. 

So at this point, what can you do if you feel you want to support me?
