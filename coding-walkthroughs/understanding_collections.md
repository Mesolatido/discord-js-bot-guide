# Understanding Collections

In this page we will explore Collections, and how to use them to grab data from various part of the API.

A **Collection** is a *utility class* that stores data. In *Discord.js 9.x*, they extend the *Map* data type with additional helpers to assist in retrieving information from them.

Examples of Collections include:

- `bot.users`, `bot.guilds`, `bot.channels`
- `guild.channels`, `guild.members`
- message logs (in the callback of `fetchMessages`)
- `bot.emojis`

> In discord.js 8 and older, the equivalent was *Caches* which extended *Array*. Since *Collections* extend *Map* instead, **the methods have changed**.

## Getting by ID

Very simply, to get anything by ID you can use `Collection.get(id)`. For instance, getting a channel can be `bot.channel.get("81385020756865024")`. Getting a user is also trivial: `bot.users.get("139412744439988224")`

## Finding by key

If you don't have the ID but only some other property, you may use `find()` to search by property: 

`let guild = bot.guilds.find("name", "Discord.js Official");`

## Custom filtering

*Collections* also have a custom way to filter their content with an anonymous function:
