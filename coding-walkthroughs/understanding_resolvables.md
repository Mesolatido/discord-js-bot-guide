# Understanding Resolvables

> **NOTE** THIS WHOLE SECTION NEEDS A REWRITE AND IS NO LONGER UP TO DATE DUE TO REWRITE

In this page we'll explore the different ways in which you can use resolvables, and identify them.

In the discord.js documentation you will come across the term *resolvable*. In essence, this word means "something used to identify an object". For instance, a *User Resolvable* is, "something used to identify a user". 


Take for instance the *Channel Resolvable*. One of its main uses is inside the **channel.sendMessage()** function, where it defines the, you guessed it, *Channel* where the message is sent. Here's what the documentation says are acceptable channel resolvables: Channel, Server, Message, User (in some instances), String of Channel ID, String of User ID.

Let's pretend you're within your `message` event handler, where you've received a message from a user on a channel. You want to reply with a message, not to the channel, but directly to the user. **client.sendMessage()** indicates that a *Channel Resolvable* can be used in its first parameter. Using the list above, then, we know that `User` is accepted. In this context, it means the message is sent to the user, *in a private message*. 

But how do you get the user? There are 2 user resolvables in the list: `User` and `String of User ID`. `User` is a user object, meaning something like `message.author` is acceptable. But it also means that a direct ID such as, say, "139412744439988224" can also work. 

## Getting resolvables

Clearly, using a resolvable in context is straightforward. `message.server` is a server resolvable, `message.author.id` is a user resolvable, and just `message` is a message resolvable (all in the context of a message of course). 

But what if you don't have the object or even the ID available? One of the questions that come back often on #node_discord-js is the use of *Role Resolvables*. *Roles* are often used to check if a user has permission to access a certain command, and the biggest mistake new users make is to try this: 

`if(bot.memberHasRole("Bot Commander")) { do something; }`

Unfortunately, the *name* of a role is not considered a *role resolvable* and this fails. This is where caches come in: 

`if(bot.memberHasRole(message.server.roles.get("name", "Bot Commander"))) { works;}`
