# Discord.js Getting Started

> **Please Note**: This guide will be updated less often due to [personal reasons](/drama.md)

## Introduction

I decided to write this guide because it's become obvious that the examples for discord.js and the documentation can be quite daunting for newcomers. There was definitely a space for this kind of document online, made obvious by the recurring questions that pop up almost every day on support channels. 

Seeing as though there needed to be some more detailed explanations as well as code samples, I figured a guide would be a great place to start!

## Updating of this guide

This guide is no longer being updated, for personal reasons. It will remain valid for Discord.js version 10 and 11, and perhaps a couple versions going forward, but I will no longer modify it or fix it.
