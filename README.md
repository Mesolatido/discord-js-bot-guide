# Discord.js bot guide

## Introduction

I decide to write this book because it's become obvious that the examples for discord.js and the documentation can be... sometimes daunting. There was definitely a space for this kind of document online, made obvious by the recurring questions that pop up almost every day on the #node_discord-js channel. 

Seeing as though there needed to be some more detailed explanations as well as code samples, I figured a "book" would be a great place to start!
