# Discord.js bot guide

## Introduction

I decide to write this gitbook because it's become obvious that the examples for discord.js and the documentation can be quite daunting for newcomers. There was definitely a space for this kind of document online, made obvious by the recurring questions that pop up almost every day on the #node_discord-js channel. 

Seeing as though there needed to be some more detailed explanations as well as code samples, I figured a "book" would be a great place to start!

## Updating of this guide

I will update this guide with each new version of discord.js, as time permits. However, I will gladly accept any contributions to this guide as long as they maintain an appropriate level of grammar and vocabulary. Please don't hesitate to contribute!

Current Discord Version: `8.0.0` 
Last Updated: `6/18/2016`

## Special Thanks

I'd like to extend my thanks to all the regular users of the Discord API server for their help in learning discord.js. They have been a great source of knowledge and examples as well as patient with my derps. Thanks guys.
