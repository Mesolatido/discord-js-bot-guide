# Discord.js Getting Started (9.x)

## Introduction

I decided to write this guide because it's become obvious that the examples for discord.js and the documentation can be quite daunting for newcomers. There was definitely a space for this kind of document online, made obvious by the recurring questions that pop up almost every day on support channels. 

Seeing as though there needed to be some more detailed explanations as well as code samples, I figured a guide would be a great place to start! 

## Patreon

Yes, this guide takes a lot of my time to write. Yes, I would appreciate some donations to keep me going. Yes, this is the first time I've ever done this.

## Updating of this guide

I will update this guide with each new version of discord.js, as time permits. However, I will gladly accept any contributions to this guide as long as they maintain an appropriate level of grammar and vocabulary. Please don't hesitate to contribute!

Current Discord.js Version: `9.0.2` 

> Since discord.js v9 is a complete rewrite, code found here is not compatible with version 8!

## Special Thanks

I'd like to extend my thanks to all the regular users of the Discord API server for their help in learning discord.js. They have been a great source of knowledge and examples as well as patient with my derps. Thanks guys.

Also, @hydrabolt , you are awesome, this is a great lib and an even better rewrite!
