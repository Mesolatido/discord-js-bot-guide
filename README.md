# Discord.js Getting Started (10.x)

## Introduction

I decided to write this guide because it's become obvious that the examples for discord.js and the documentation can be quite daunting for newcomers. There was definitely a space for this kind of document online, made obvious by the recurring questions that pop up almost every day on support channels. 

Seeing as though there needed to be some more detailed explanations as well as code samples, I figured a guide would be a great place to start!
