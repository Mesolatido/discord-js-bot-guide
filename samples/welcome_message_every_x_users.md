# Welcome Message every X users

This sample will show how to keep an array/object of new users coming into a server. Then, when this array reaches a certain number of users, it shows a message welcoming those users as a group. When your server becomes popular and you get dozens of users every day, you will find this to be much less annoying than welcoming one user at a time!
